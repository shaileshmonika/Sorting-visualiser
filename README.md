# Sorting-visualiser
A sorting visualizer is a program that provides visual representation of sorting algorithms in action. It allows users to observe different sorting methods. The visualiser typically displays the initial unsorted array and animates the sorting process step by step, showing the changes made to the array at each iteration.
